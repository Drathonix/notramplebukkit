# No Trample Bukkit
Literally 20 lines of code don't @me

To use just put it in your plugins folder and start the server. Its not hard. Just put this jar in there.
This is a BUKKIT/SPIGOT plugin so don't try to use this with Sponge.

### This plugin will not prevent players or villagers from harvesting crops. It will just stop farmland from turning into dirt.

## Why did I make this?
I made this because apparently no one has ever made an anti crop trampling plugin with like 10 million other unnecessary features. NoTrample has one job stopping trampling.
